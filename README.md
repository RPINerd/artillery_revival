# Artillery Revival

This is a revival of a remake that was originally done by Jean-Francois Gagnon (jfgagnon) on the [Pygame website](https://www.pygame.org/project/1519)

## Original Description

Artillery Duel Reloaded is a remake of the classic game "Artillery Duel" for C64 released in 1983 by Xonox. The goal is to provide similar gameplay, but with upgraded graphics.
**A decent computer is required in order to play without noticeable lag**
At the moment, the game is playable, but still unfinished. A lot of things, including computer AI, have yet to be implemented. This game is being developped mostly to learn object oriented programming, so most of the code is a mess, for now at least.
**Warning: this is a demo version, so the game may crash unexpectedly**
